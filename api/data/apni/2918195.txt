Corymbia terminalis is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30–35 m (98–115 ft) and forms a lignotuber. The trunk is almost always straight, making up a half to two thirds of the total tree height, with a crown of slender branches. It has rough, tessellated greyish bark on the lower 1–4 m (3 ft 3 in–13 ft 1 in) of the trunk, abruptly changing to smooth whitish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs at first, 55–110 mm (2.2–4.3 in) long and 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) wide, tapering to a short petiole or sessile. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green to greyish on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to linear, 90–240 mm (3.5–9.4 in) long and 6–25 mm (0.24–0.98 in) wide on a petiole 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long.[2][3][4][5][6]
