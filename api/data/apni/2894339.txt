Angophora leiocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25 m (82 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pink to orange or greyish bark that is shed is small patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are narrow lance-shaped, 45–140 mm (1.8–5.5 in) long and 7–28 mm (0.28–1.10 in) wide with a stem-clasping base, and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped or curved, 55–160 mm (2.2–6.3 in) long and 6–25 mm (0.24–0.98 in) wide tapering to a petiole 6–15 mm (0.24–0.59 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched, glabrous peduncle 9–32 mm (0.35–1.26 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three, rarely seven buds, on pedicels 3–8 mm (0.12–0.31 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide with a smooth to slightly ribbed floral cup and petals about 3 mm (0.12 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide. Flowering has been observed from November to February and the fruit is a thin-walled, barrel-shaped to cup-shaped capsule 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[3][4][5][6]
