Eucalyptus eugenioides is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25–30 m (82–98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. Its trunk is 70 cm (28 in) wide at chest height and has rough, stringy, grey to reddish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves 45–80 mm (1.8–3.1 in) long and 15–35 mm (0.59–1.38 in) wide, glossy green on the upper surface and distinctly paler below. Adult leaves are more or less the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, 70–160 mm (2.8–6.3 in) long and 9–35 mm (0.35–1.38 in) wide on a petiole 6–20 mm (0.24–0.79 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of nine to fifteen, on an unbranched peduncle 5–17 mm (0.20–0.67 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) long. Mature buds are green to yellow, oval to spindle-shaped, 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from July to January. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long and 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) wide with the valves near rim level or slightly beyond.[2][3][4][5]
