Eucalyptus propinqua is a tree that typically grows to a height of 40 m (130 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth mottled grey, cream-coloured and yellowish bark that is shed in strips. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross section and leaves that are a paler shade on the lower surface, 40–75 mm (1.6–3.0 in) long, 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are a paler shade of green on the lower side, lance-shaped to curved, 60–170 mm (2.4–6.7 in) long and 15–25 mm (0.59–0.98 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) long. The flower buds are mostly arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen on an unbranched peduncle 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 1–5 mm (0.039–0.197 in) long. Mature buds are club-shaped to oval, 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long and about 3 mm (0.12 in) wide with a conical to rounded or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from January to April and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical or hemispherical capsule 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide with the valves strongly protruding.[2][3][4][5]
