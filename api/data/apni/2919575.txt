Eucalyptus acmenoides is a tree that grows to a height of 50 metres (164 ft) or more, although only half that height in dry sites. It has thin stringy or fibrous, grey to reddish brown bark. Leaves on young trees are egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped glossy green, up to 120 mm (5 in) long and 30 mm (1 in) wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green but much paler on the lower side, 80–120 mm (3–5 in) long and 15–25 mm (0.6–1 in) wide. The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly between seven and eleven on an angular peduncle 6–15 mm (0.2–0.6 in) long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel 2–6 mm (0.08–0.2 in) long. The buds are oval to spindle-shaped, 5–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide. The operculum is conical or beak-shaped, about as long and wide as the flower cup. The fruit is a globe-shaped to hemispherical capsule, 4–8 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and 4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) wide.[3][4][5]
