Eucalyptus seeana is a tree that typically grows to a height of 40 m (130 ft) and forms a lignotuber. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, greyish green leaves that are linear to lance-shaped, 50–120 mm (2.0–4.7 in) long and 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to lance-shaped, 100–180 mm (3.9–7.1 in) long and 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle 5–13 mm (0.20–0.51 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 2–6 mm (0.079–0.236 in) long. Mature buds are oblong to spindle-shaped, 10–16 mm (0.39–0.63 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide with a horn-shaped operculum 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) long. Flowering has been observed in November and December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long and 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide with the valves protruding strongly.[2][3][4]
