Eucalyptus melanophloia is a tree, rarely a mallee, that typically grows to a height of 20–25 m (66–82 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, rough, dark grey to black bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are usually glaucous, arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, round to egg-shaped or heart-shaped, 20–100 mm (0.79–3.94 in) long and 13–100 mm (0.51–3.94 in) wide. The crown leaves are usually mostly juvenile leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, the same dull glaucous colour on both sides, egg-shaped to heart-shaped or lance-shaped, 35–90 mm (1.4–3.5 in) long and 20–50 mm (0.79–1.97 in) wide. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of the branchlets in groups of seven on a branching peduncle 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long. The individual buds are on pedicels 2–9 mm (0.079–0.354 in) long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in January and February, and from June to August. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule 3–8 mm (0.12–0.31 in) long and wide with the valves near or below rim level.[2][3][4]
