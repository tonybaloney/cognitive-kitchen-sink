Plants in the genus Angophora are trees, occasionally shrubs, with rough bark except for A. costata. The juvenile leaves differ from adult leaves in being hairy with raised oil glands. Both juvenile and adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, the adult leaves usually glabrous and paler on the lower surface. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven. The flower has four or five small sepals, reduced to small projections on the rim of the floral cup. There are four or five more or less round, keeled, overlapping petals and whorls of many creamy white stamens. Unlike in Eucalyptus and Corymbia, the petals and sepals are not fused to form a cap-like operculum. The fruit is a papery or thin, slightly woody, hairy capsule with longitudinal ribs.[2][3][4]
