Eucalyptus curtisii is a slender mallee or small tree that typically grows to a height of 7–12 m (23–39 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey to silvery bark that is shed in short curly flakes. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves that are 30–62 mm (1.2–2.4 in) long and 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) wide and a slightly darker shade of green on the upper surface. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, elliptic or curved, glossy green but much paler on the lower surface. They are 60–140 mm (2.4–5.5 in) long and 10–30 mm (0.39–1.18 in) wide on a petiole 7–18 mm (0.28–0.71 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a branching inflorescence near the ends of the stems, each branch with groups of seven buds. The groups are on a peduncle 7–17 mm (0.28–0.67 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) long and 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from September to December and the flowers are white to creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, wrinkled capsule 5–11 mm (0.20–0.43 in) long and 6–11 mm (0.24–0.43 in) wide.[2][3][4][5]
