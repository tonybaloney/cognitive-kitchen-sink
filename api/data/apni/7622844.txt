Eucalyptus fibrosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of 35 m (115 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, grey to black, sometimes flaky ironbark from the base of the trunk to the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have petiolate, egg-shaped to more or less triangular or round leaves that are 80–200 mm (3.1–7.9 in) long, 45–140 mm (1.8–5.5 in) wide and a slightly lighter shade of green on one side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same shade of green on both sides, 85–180 mm (3.3–7.1 in) long and 15–45 mm (0.59–1.77 in) wide on a petiole 13–30 mm (0.51–1.18 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a branching peduncle 9–20 mm (0.35–0.79 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, 8–17 mm (0.31–0.67 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long and wide
with the valves close to rim level.[2][3][4]
