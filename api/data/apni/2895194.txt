Angophora woodsiana is a tree that typically grows to a height of 20 m (66 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous grey or brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 55–100 mm (2.2–3.9 in) long and 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green but paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved, 75–170 mm (3.0–6.7 in) long and 17–45 mm (0.67–1.77 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long. The flowers are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 9–32 mm (0.35–1.26 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels 10–18 mm (0.39–0.71 in) long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) long and wide with a ribbed floral cup. The petals are white or creamy white with a green keel, 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and wide. Flowering occurs between December and January and the fruit is a cup-shaped capsule 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4]
