The pink bloodwood is tree that can reach 20–30 m (65–100 ft) in height with a 10–20 m (35–65 ft) spread. The bark is rough, tessellated, light brown to grey in colour and extends from the trunk to the branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, 80–160 mm (3.1–6.3 in) long and 20–42 mm (0.79–1.65 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, leathery, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped, 80–150 mm (3.1–5.9 in) long and 13–40 mm (0.51–1.57 in) wide on a petiole 12–25 mm (0.47–0.98 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels 2–15 mm (0.079–0.591 in) long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, 7–10 mm (0.28–0.39 in) long and 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) wide with a conical to rounded or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from December to March and the profuse perfumed white or cream flowers are up to 20 mm (0.79 in) in diameter. The fruit is an urn-shaped, oval or barrel-shaped capsule 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and 8–16 mm (0.31–0.63 in) wide with a short neck and the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4][5][6][7]
