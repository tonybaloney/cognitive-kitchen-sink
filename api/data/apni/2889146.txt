Corymbia henryi is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25–30 m (82–98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mottled grey, cream-coloured and pink bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 80–250 mm (3.1–9.8 in) long and 40–100 mm (1.6–3.9 in) wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, 110–280 mm (4.3–11.0 in) long and 22–45 mm (0.87–1.77 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in) long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with three buds on pedicels 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, 12–13 mm (0.47–0.51 in) long and 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) wide with a conical, beaked operculum. Flowering has been observed in January, April and November and the flowers are white or lemon-yellow. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to urn-shaped capsule 9–15 mm (0.35–0.59 in) long and 9–16 mm (0.35–0.63 in) wide with the valves inclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4][5][6]
