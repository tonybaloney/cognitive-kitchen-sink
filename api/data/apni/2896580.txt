Eucalyptus punctata is a tree that typically grows to a height of 35 m (115 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey, brown or cream-coloured bark that is shed in patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, 55–115 mm (2.2–4.5 in) long and 15–35 mm (0.59–1.38 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are glossy dark green, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved to egg-shaped, 60–180 mm (2.4–7.1 in) long and 14–37 mm (0.55–1.46 in) wide tapering to a petiole 13–26 mm (0.51–1.02 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long. Mature buds are oval, 6–9 mm (0.24–0.35 in) long and 4–9 mm (0.16–0.35 in) wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from December to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped or hemispherical capsule 4–9 mm (0.16–0.35 in) long and 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) wide.[2][3][4][5]
