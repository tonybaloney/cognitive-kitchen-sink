Corymbia citriodora is a tree that typically grows to a height of 25–40 m (82–131 ft), sometimes to 50 m (160 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale, uniform or slightly mottled, white to pink or coppery bark that is shed in thin flakes. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 80–210 mm (3.1–8.3 in) long and 32–80 mm (1.3–3.1 in) wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, often lemon-scented when crushed, narrow lance-shaped to curved, 100–230 mm (3.9–9.1 in) long and 6–28 mm (0.24–1.10 in) wide tapering to a petiole 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on a branched peduncle 3–10 mm (0.12–0.39 in) long, each branch with three buds on pedicels 1–6 mm (0.039–0.236 in) long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) long and 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) wide with a rounded, conical or slightly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule 8–15 mm (0.31–0.59 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4][5][6]
