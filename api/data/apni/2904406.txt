Eucalyptus robusta grows commonly as a straight, upright tree to around 20–30 metres (70–100 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) in diameter at breast height (dbh). The trunk and branches are covered with thick red-brown bark, which has a spongy feel and is stringy—peeling in longitudinal strips. The long irregular branches spread laterally, and form a dense canopy with the broad green leaves. Arranged alternately along the stems, these measure 10–16 centimetres (3.9–6.3 inches) long by 2.7 to 4.5 cm (1.1 to 1.8 in) wide. Adult leaves are broadly lanceolate to ovate, green and glossy, and with closely spaced "feather-like" side veins running at greater than 45° angle to the main midrib.[3]
