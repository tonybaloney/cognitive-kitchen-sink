Eucalyptus carnea is a tree that grows to a height of 25–30 metres (82–98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough grey or brownish, stringy or fibrous bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to curved, 80–200 mm (3.1–7.9 in) long, 35–100 mm (1–4 in) wide and a different shade on either side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, 80–170 mm (3.1–6.7 in) long and 17–40 mm (0.7–2 in) wide on a petiole 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long. The leaves are bluish green on one side and a lighter green on the other. The flowers are borne in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on a sometimes branched peduncle, 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide with a conical to slightly beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long and 5–8 mm (0.2–0.3 in) wide with the valves about level with the rim.[2][3]
