Eucalyptus moluccana is a tree that typically grows to a height of 30 m (98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has persistent rough, fibrous or flaky bark on part or all of the trunk, smooth whitish or light grey bark above, sometimes with a shiny surface. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are paler on the lower surface, 40–80 mm (1.6–3.1 in) long, 25–55 mm (0.98–2.17 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, 70–170 mm (2.8–6.7 in) long and 15–65 mm (0.59–2.56 in) wide on a petiole 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) long and with many oil glands. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of usually seven, on a branched peduncle 6–13 mm (0.24–0.51 in) wide, the individual buds on pedicels 2–5 mm (0.079–0.197 in) long. The buds are spindle-shaped to diamond-shaped, 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) long and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) long and 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) wide with the valves enclosed.[2][3][4][5]
