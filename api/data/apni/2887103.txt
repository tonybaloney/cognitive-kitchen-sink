Eucalyptus tindaliae is a tree that typically grows to a height of 27–30 m (89–98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, stringy grey bark on the trunk and larger branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, 30–95 mm (1.2–3.7 in) long and 14–45 mm (0.55–1.77 in) wide. Adult leaves are more or less the same shade of green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, 60–140 mm (2.4–5.5 in) long and 12–37 mm (0.47–1.46 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 6–20 mm (0.24–0.79 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and fifteen on an unbranched peduncle 5–18 mm (0.20–0.71 in) long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to 2 mm (0.079 in) long. Mature buds are oval, 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from May to August in the north of its range and from January to March in the south. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody hemispherical capsule 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long and 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) wide with the valves at or below rim level.[2][3][4][5]
