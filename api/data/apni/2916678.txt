Corymbia torelliana typically grows to a height of 25–30 metres (82–98 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greenish grey to white bark, although older specimens often have rough, tessellated, greyish bark on the lower trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have heart-shaped to egg-shaped or elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface, paler below, 90–145 mm (3.5–5.7 in) long and 60–105 mm (2.4–4.1 in) wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to heart-shaped or lance-shaped, 60–160 mm (2.4–6.3 in) long and 15–85 mm (0.59–3.35 in) wide on a petiole 10–24 mm (0.39–0.94 in) long. There are many small oil dots visible to the naked eye.[2][3][4][5][6]
