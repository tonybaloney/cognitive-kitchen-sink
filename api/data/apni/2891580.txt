Eucalyptus major is a tree that typically grows to a height of 20 m (66 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, blotched greyish bark that is shed in large plates or flakes. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are a lighter shade of green on the lower side, 75–100 mm (3.0–3.9 in) long and 25–40 mm (0.98–1.57 in) wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, dark green on the upper surface, paler below, 90–200 mm (3.5–7.9 in) long and 20–40 mm (0.79–1.57 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a flattened, unbranched peduncle 7–15 mm (0.28–0.59 in) long, the individual buds sessile or a pedicels up to 5 mm (0.20 in) long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, 6–9 mm (0.24–0.35 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical to cup-shaped capsule 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long and 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) wide with the valves protruding prominently above the rim of the fruit.[2][3][4]
