Eucalyptus pilularis is a tree that typically grows to a height of 70 m (230 ft) but does not form a lignotuber. It has finely fibrous, greyish brown bark on the lower half of the trunk, white to grey or cream-coloured bark above, often with insect scribbles. Young plants have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and leaves that are dull green, paler on the lower surface, sessile and mostly arranged in opposite pairs. The juvenile leaves are lance-shaped, 55–130 mm (2.2–5.1 in) long and 10–36 mm (0.39–1.42 in) wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, more or less the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, 75–170 mm (3.0–6.7 in) long and 12–32 mm (0.47–1.26 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 8–22 mm (0.31–0.87 in) long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen on a flattened, unbranched peduncle 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped or spindle-shaped, 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from January to April or from October to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical, shortened spherical or oval capsule 5–11 mm (0.20–0.43 in) long and 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) wide with four valves near rim level or below it.[2][3][4][5][6]
