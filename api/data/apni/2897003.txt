Corymbia trachyphloia is a tree that typically grows to a height of 15 m (49 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, brown and greyish bark on the trunk, often also on the larger branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, 50–120 mm (2.0–4.7 in) long, 10–35 mm (0.39–1.38 in) wide and petiolate, the petiole is attached to the underside of the leaf blade. Adult leaves are usually glossy dark green, paler on the lower surface, narrow lance-shaped to lance-shaped, 65–140 mm (2.6–5.5 in) long and 9–26 mm (0.35–1.02 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) long, The flower buds are arranged on a branched peduncle 4–13 mm (0.16–0.51 in) long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from December to June and the flowers are white. The fruit is a thin-walled, urn-shaped capsule 6–10 mm (0.24–0.39 in) long and 5–8 mm (0.20–0.31 in) wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4]
